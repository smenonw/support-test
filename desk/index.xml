      <description>Overview WETHOD follows a weekly cycle: we think that a week is a good trade-off between the need to control the project&amp;rsquo;s progress as much as possible and the need to not burden the control activities.
Every Friday an e-mail will remind:
 Each project manager to compile the Project Status for its projects; Each collaborator to compile the Timesheet for the projects he worked on.  Timesheet Remember to insert only the real worked hours, cheating isn&amp;rsquo;t useful to anybody.</description>
